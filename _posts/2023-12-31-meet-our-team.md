# Meet our Team
**In order to obtain fresh ideas to help us approach problems from different perspectives, the MCMA relies on the support of a constantly changing volunteer group consisting of professionals and students working in various fields with diverse backgrounds. However, in order to maintain the baseline quality and enforce rigorous evaluation procedures on our projects, we have formed a mathematics expert/advisory group to help us improve our work. Here is the complete list of advisory group members as of November 2023.**
